        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jake Howdeshell welcome to my coding portfolio page.
          A few fun facts about me are that I am task oriented, enjoy breaking
          my work into accomplishable sections to keep my motivation high! I am
          an avid climber and enjoy being in the outdoors soaking up the sun and
          fresh air. Lastly I am a big fan of live music and try to catch as
          many live shows as I can, typically hearing the band for the first
          time a couple days before the concert.
        </p>

          My professional background covers everything from sales, and customer
          service, to manual labor, to platform management. In the last few
          years I have been more exposed to the tech side of things and found a
          lot of enjoyment in the problem solving aspect and the limitmess
          potential to create and recreate helpful tools, applications, and
          websites. Please check out my current work, contact information, and
          resume provided below. I am currently on the hunt for new and exciting
          work opportunities in the tech field!
